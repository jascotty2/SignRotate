Sign Rotate
rotates signs :)

while adding signs functionality to bettershop, i got to thinking: wouldn't it be neat if they could spin around on their own? 
well, shortly thereafter, here it is:
a plugin that provides such useless and amusing functionality :)
to set a sign rotating: run /sr, then click on the sign
(to stop, click again, to stop setting them on & off, run /sr again)

features: 
rotates signs :)
ingame-configurable:
- delay between each rotation
- rotate direction
permissions support:
- signrotate.create 	to add/remove rotating signs
- signrotate.admin	to change plugin settings
saves assigned signs & reloads at start


commands:
/signrotate (sr) 		toggle sign adding
/signrotate (sr) cw / ccw	change rotation direction
/signrotate (sr) delay <time>	change delay interval (seconds)


Todo:
allow wall signs to "rotate" around its block
iConomy support?
allow blocks to rotate (not just signs) ?
- if there is a sign/torch on a face, rotate 4
- else, rotate 8
